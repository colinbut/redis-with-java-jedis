# Redis with Java using Jedis

This is a demo project aimed at demonstrating some of the basic features of Redis with Java (using the Java implementation redis client library - Jedis).

__*note__ _There are many redis clients (implemented in Java) out there and Jedis is only one of them. I'm showcasing using Jedis
as apparently it is not only the most popular but lightweight and appeared to be the most supported by the community albeit lacking some
powerful advanced functionality_


1. Download Redis from Redis's website and install it following their instructions.
2. Start Up Redis
3. Run the examples in this demo project (and feel free to experiment)
